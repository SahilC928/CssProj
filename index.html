            <li>CSS stand for cascading style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS discribe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
            <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not neccesary</span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files. </li>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h2>
    <div>
        <ul class="ulis" type="disc" >
            <li>Inline -by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,
                 <span style="background-color: yellow;">in this <br> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> 
                 because this easier to demonstrate, and easier <br> for you to try it yourself.</li>


        </ul>

   <p> When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elemnets. ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br>
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
   <p> In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elemnet or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br>
    elemnet. <br></p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elemnets to which a style should be applied
